# Task 1 - Stock Price Prediction
## Problem Statement : To predict the Stock Price of a Company using LSTM.
### About the dataset:
The Google stock dataset contains historical data of Google's stock prices and related attributes. It consists of 14 columns and 1257 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

* Symbol: The name of the company, which is GOOG in this case.
* Date: The year and date of the stock data.
* Close: The closing price of Google's stock on a particular day.
* High: The highest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
* Low: The lowest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
* Open: The opening value of Google's stock on the given day.
* Volume: The trading volume of Google's stock on the given day, i.e., the number of shares traded.
* adjClose: The adjusted closing price of Google's stock, considering factors such as dividends and stock splits.
* adjHigh: The adjusted highest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
* adjLow: The adjusted lowest value reached by Google's stock on the given day.
* adjOpen: The adjusted opening value of Google's stock on the given day.
* adjVolume: The adjusted trading volume of Google's stock on the given day, accounting for factors such as stock splits.
* divCash: The amount of cash dividend paid out to shareholders on the given day.
* splitFactor: The split factor, if any, applied to Google's stock on the given day. A split factor of 1 indicates no split.

This dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Analyzing the historical performance of Google's stock.
* Building predictive models to forecast Google's future stock prices.
* Developing trading strategies to profit from the movement of Google's stock prices.

# Task 2 - Titanic Classification
## Problem Statement : To make a system that tells whether a Person will be saved from Sinking or not.
### About the dataset:
Titanic is one of history's most infamous shipwrecks. The Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 of the 2224 passengers and crew. This shocking tragedy shocked the international community and resulted in stricter ship safety regulations. While survival required some luck, it appears that some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we must create a predictive model that answers the question "what types of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (such as name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, and so on).

The columns in the dataset are as follows:
* PassengerId: Passenger Identity
* Survived: Whether passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Class of ticket, a proxy for socio-economic status (SES) (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Name: Name of passenger Sex: Sex of passenger
* Age: Age of passenger in years
* SibSp: Number of sibling and/or spouse travelling with passenger
* Parch: Number of parent and/or children travelling with passenger
* Ticket: Ticket number Fare: Price of ticket
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
